# HighTravel

**High, Travel!** will provide a service for people planning trip with someone else. Our service can be of help in all processes of trip, from start to end. While planning the trip, users share the itinerary and budget. Also they can confirm travel routes with map and come up with the rules. During the trip, users can record their expenses, organize pictures by date and places. Finally, after the travel, users can solve the financial problems easily, and look back on their trip with photos and diary neatly organized.
